# Risk to Reward Ratio MT5

This code is a sample implementation of a risk to reward ratio calculation tool for the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) trading platform. It allows users to input their trade details, such as the entry price, stop loss level, and take profit level, and calculates the potential loss, potential profit, and risk to reward ratio.

## Usage

To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary libraries: `Trade.mqh` and `PositionInfo.mqh`.

2. Define the `CalculateRiskToRewardRatio` function, which takes the entry price, stop loss level, and take profit level as parameters. It calculates the potential loss and potential profit based on these values and then calculates the risk to reward ratio by dividing the potential loss by the potential profit.

3. Define the `DisplayValues` function, which takes the potential loss, potential profit, and risk to reward ratio as parameters. It displays these values to the user using the `Print` function.

4. Define the `HandleUserInputs` function, which handles user inputs and executes trades. It prompts the user to enter the trade details, calculates the risk to reward ratio using the `CalculateRiskToRewardRatio` function, calculates the potential loss and profit in pips, displays the calculated values using the `DisplayValues` function, and executes trades based on the user inputs (implementation required).

5. Define the entry point of the program, the `OnStart` function. It calls the `HandleUserInputs` function to handle user inputs and execute trades.
